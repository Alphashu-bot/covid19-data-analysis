# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the  
[Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv).  
The goal is to extract meaningful insights about **global cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage** using Python and Power BI, with a focus on healthcare data analytics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL:** Data extraction and queries (Joins, Aggregations)  
- **Power BI / Tableau:** Interactive dashboards  
- **Excel:** Initial data cleaning and reporting  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Top 5 countries** (USA, India, Brazil, etc.) accounted for the majority of global cases.  
- **Vaccination coverage** shows strong negative correlation with death rates.  
- **Case growth** globally flattened after large-scale vaccination campaigns.  
- Dashboards allow easy filtering by **country and time range**.
